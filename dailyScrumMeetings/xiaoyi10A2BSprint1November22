What did I work on in the last three days?
    - implemented first portions of Move and Copy
   
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- complete implementation of Move and Copy
	- change Remove to be able to remove indirect ancestors
	- change behavior of // input on ChangeDirectory
	- ensure Exit command is working
	- upload Directory class update

Am I blocked on anything?
