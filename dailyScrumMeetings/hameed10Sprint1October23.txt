What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Made Commands collaborate with JShell
    - Decided a tentative plan on how Commands may look 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Add on to the Commands skeleton code I have created 
    - Validate user input 
    - Find a design to incorporate Man in all classes 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - How to give errors/ which errors to account for in each command?
