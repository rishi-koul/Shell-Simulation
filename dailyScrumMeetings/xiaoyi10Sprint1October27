What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Changed ChangeDirectory Class to handle user error
    - this may be redundant if implemented elsewhere
    - Changed ChangeDirectory Class to handle path relative to current 
    directory and going back 1 directory
   
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Discuss with team on design specifics moving forward
    - especially those of FileSystem class
    - begin implementation of n-1, o-1, m-1

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Specifics of data structure
    - Where to implement certain validations and outputs
