What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Wrote code for Jshell so that input is parsed seperately into commands 
      and argument. 
    - Added code to display the directory path in Jshell
    - Modified the getDirectorypath in Directory class to return a string.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continuously update JShell with new information.
    - On the new classes which i will be assigned in next sprint

Am I blocked on anything?
    - getDirectorypath() is not returning the proper path have to discuss
